      <div class="regulartop">
        <h1 class="heading-2">Changes in the last 5 years include: Compliance Rules, PCI / E Com regulation, tax/privacy/wallets. Web 3 emerging with real time API data resolving across multiple channels. GA4 and Data Compliance rules apply to real time Data Syncing.<br><br>The shape, update and scaling of data has changed radically in the past 5 years. Has your database, compliance, security for your Enterprise Organization kept up?<br><br>How do you future proof?</h1>
        <h2 class="heading3">SSL Publishing</h2>
        <div class="regulartext left">HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is now a must. &quot;legacy&quot; publishing for a single domain name hosted in a database linked CMS (Drupal, Wordpress, Site Core), will only be able to have a single certificate associated with a single domain. <br><br>Modern CMS (Netlify, Vercel, Contentful, Sanity, Webflow) publish SSL by default for free.<br><br>Drupal and Wordpress have RESTful endpoints that can support feeds that will publish to REST publishing. These REST based publishing (Gatsby, Gridsome, Svelte, 11ty, Astro) can sync and be designed to work in tandem with as is &quot;traditional&quot; CMS and Page/File system development.<br><br>360 Marketing Opportunities: Shoppable emails, Geo Fenced resource/segment referencing, Personalized Entitlement/Gated Content, Automated List Resource/Customer/Cart Tagging, will need &quot;headless&quot; architectures to be built in tandem with traditional services and functional program management.<br></div>
        <h2 class="heading3">PCI E Com Rules</h2>
        <div class="regulartext left _50btm">E Com needs to be ADA Compliant. Penalties and regulations, include preventing storage of CSV files on Desktop Computers. A Solid system of data governance and real time moderation needs to be simple to use and immediately actionable.<br><br>If a customer requests to be removed from data tracking, a record process needs to have a clear documented workflow. Data that is sourced from CSV files, and personal desktop storage, is no longer viable, and will suffer from pretty severe regulatory penalties.<br><br>Importance of removing the CSV files of un synchronized data from multiple desktops is a critical path for modern data.<br><br>A singular database that is &quot;Enterprise&quot; needs to be supported with solid Real Time API data modeling on client and server functions, roles, composition, and updating. All Data on Client and Server must be synchronized in real time. API first adoption must be adopted. API to backend service logic is Front End / client side. Client / Server and middleware must align with existing on prem &quot;database&quot; and security.<br><br>Security rules that are more than 5 years old, might be an Enterprise Organization&#x27;s biggest vulnerability. The very visible database, that is a clear target can be hardened with distributed unstructured API data storage, that cannot be broken with Single Point of Failure Vulnerability.<br></div>
        <div class="regulartext _50btm left">Use regular CSS/HTML/JS, to prototype. Webflow, Plasmic, Slice Machine, builder.io, Astro/11ty, exports paired with SSG &quot;Server Rendered&quot; dynamic backends: Sanity, Contentful, Prismic, gives you free to use infinitely scalable SSL secure development environments at no cost. <br><br>The reason Wordpress is approaching more than a third adoption for all sites is, because content stakeholder can edit and create new content/design without friction. In spite of a bulky and often insecure database, UI, deployment pairing.<br><br>Designing efficient fast loading easily maintained and secure work streams are an after thought. Sites and Databases are often not maintained. <br><br>Design Personalization, 3d Animation, Customization with Builders, Swatch Libraries, integrations to Inventory Management in real time, with shippable code.<br><br>Upload to real time deployment: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Github Pages. Utilize non breaking publishing that is secure and role moderated, to CDN to bespoke, Enterprise, Gated, Stand Alone Apps, Personalized Services, CRMs, and &quot;Legacy&quot; CMS. Build cloned UI/UX in Headless Workflows to parallel. <br><br>Organize Naming, Image Compression (source sets), ALT tags, ADA compliance and content in real time.<br><br>Use best case tools: Angular, Vue, React (Next, Gatsby, Native), Svelte, or just plain static, combinations of Frameworks/Libraries also work, per your use case. There is no privilege or &quot;best&quot; way to approach complex library builds/and compiles. Utilize, open source real time design tools. Unlimited previews and collaboration interaction optimize Design, Strategy and Revenue Generation. Unlimited variations and Data Models can be previewed privately and in public. Asset Optimization and updates are created with SEO/Tagging/Filtering built into page build process. Templates and Themes can be securely in real time, and published with Calendar/Targeting Events. Webhook can link UI/CSS/Templates/Authorization to secure APIs and Publish in Real Time Builds.<br><br>Build Personas and link via rich and clean APIs to segmentation and 360 conversion with easy to use tools.<br><br></div>

If you also want to add a form to E Commerce (Shopify, Magento, SF Commerce, a custom app like a bundler/variant swatch image/custom css color PIM) utilize free to use &quot;headless&quot; data stores: I love the team at Xano.

Even if you are depending on &quot;legacy&quot; security: passwords, 2 factor authentication, anything that is machine based 1 size fits many access, with intent a sentient machine algorithm will be able to disable it.

The idea that guardrails and defending the On Prem Database is &quot;privileged&quot; is a daunting task to overcome.<br><br>You don&#x27;t have to throw out the baby with the bath water. You just need to add extra toys to the bath.<br><br>A Database and UI/UX that is in a &quot;protected&quot; On Prem Container or in a &quot;secure&quot; Cloud, has been the norm for the past 20 years.<br><br>10 years ago the &quot;Legacy&quot; CMS and WMS/ERPs systems started slowly adopting, REST based services. Wordpress added a Graph QL enabled plugin in 2016. SAP and Salesforce APIs added GraphQL endpoints as recent as the last year.<br><br>You will need a FRONT END/CLient and Server Side Middleware to Resolve and Utilize these resources.You will also need a file stack naming publishing and secure storage of tokens in an .env publishing flow, to be secure.<br><br>APIs and server calls can utilize Free to Use open source Fetch and Data Enabled modeling and Transformation Services. GraphQL, Groq (Sanity), Add Ons (Xano). Fetch and Axios will retrieve query and model &quot;Feeds&quot;. Subscribers to the &quot;Feeds&quot; include Inventory Managers like: WMS services, EDI endpoint and delivery alerts, Customer ORM data and connectivity to Payment Gateways like Stripe, Authorize.Net, Fraud Protection like Stripe Fraud Automation.<br><br>In order to customize UX with Front End Template system you will need CI CD Pipeline (AGILE code management: Github and Deployment - Vercel, Netlify) Heroku recently pivoted to a <strong>paid</strong> deployment and is no longer recommended. The assessment for Enterprise Grade resources are:</div>

          <div>
            <div class="text-block">Great tools like Vercel, Netlify, Github, Supabase, Sanity, Xano are &quot;free&quot; to use, and have nominal upcharges, that enable: security, collaboration, scaling with background tasks.<br><br>When evaluation of Middleware consider the API tools that are free to use with your &quot;as is&quot; system prior to going to a middleware service that will lock you into APIs that will prevent you from leaving paid services. This is especially recommended for E Commerce dependent work flows. Avoid Pay to play services. If you utilize ERP that only takes and API handler that costs an additional $500,000, there are MUCH CHEAPER alternatives, that will give you A LOT more secure data.<br><br>It is IMPORTANT to understand, it is not an &quot;either or choice&quot; of Wordpress, REST, or Headless. They work together. Utilize what is free to use and what efficiently scales, without cost or effort. Compromise for Design, Marketing, Tech can be avoided if all tools are collaboratively utilized.<br><br>‍</div>
